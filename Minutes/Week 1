Week 1 Minutes

Attendees: Marco Jara Blanco, Mary Khreich, Jack Lunn, Zhanbo Zhu

This week, we went through the C Lab assignment and created a pseudo-plan of how to complete all the exercises and integrate them into one file. 

We then created a high level overview of all the functions and commands we require, focusing mainly on the purpose of the interrupt and how we 
can optimise memory.

We discussed some general methods to initalise variables. For example, the advantages of using dynamically allocated memory for our arrays as they 
may vary in length.

We agreed that by next meeting, we will have the following ready:
- The interrupt vector
- Reading from the serial port and storing values in an array
- Some commands
